      <P>
        BaselineST isn a novel machine learning model that incorporates the
        SoftTriple loss into existing distance metric learning techniques
        to elevate the state-of-the-art baseline performance in few-shot classification.
      </P>
      <P>
        In this model, a feature extractor and a Baseline++ classifier is trained from scratch with
        a hybrid loss function that combines the SoftTriple loss and standard cross-entropy
        loss. The goal is to improve model performance by capturing the hidden distribution of
        the dataset by reducing the intra-class variance, as each class is assigned multiple representative
        centers rather than one from the conventional SoftMax loss function.
        In the fine-tuning stage, the general structure from Baseline++ is retained and a
        new classifier is trained and fine-turned with the labeled examples from the support set.
        The model is evaluated in tasks such as image classification (with CUB-200-2011 dataset)
        and cross-domain character recognition (Omniglot -&gt; EMNIST).
      </P>
      <P>
        An alternative model, denoted as BaselineST+, is also investigated in the Appendix section
        of the paper. In BaselineST+, a classifier is built with the SoftTriple loss by summing up
        the resulting weights of each centroid from the same class, whic is then fed through a
        SoftMax function to finalize the probability for each class.
