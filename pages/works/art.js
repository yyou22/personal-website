        Art and design have always been central to my creative journey. 
        Starting with traditional techniques like charcoal, acrylics, and watercolor, I attended the Rhode Island School of Design&apos;s pre-college program in 2015, where three of my artworks were selected for exhibition. 
        Recently, I&apos;ve shifted my focus to digital art, graphic design, and UI/UX design, combining my artistic foundation with modern tools. 
        While my coding and research projects don&apos;t explicitly showcase my art, you can still see the impact of my design background in how I approach and present my work.
