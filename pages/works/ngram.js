        Pop AI is a music-generating application implemented with three N-gram
        variants (Unigram, Bigram & Trigram) that reads from an inventory of
        pre-loaded songs and generates novel note sequences by detecting language
        patterns found in those music. It utilizes natural language processing techniques and a
        Python program named PySynth to generate short clips of music and then combines
        the output with a selection from a pre-defined set of drum beats and bass loops.

        A separate Reddit Bot is implemented that replies to any comment exactly once on
        a Reddit Threadt if it contains the words "music" or "lyric," regardless of
        the letter case. If the comment contains "lyrics," the bot will reply with
        artificially generated lyrics. If the comment contains "music," the bot will generate
        music, access its own google drive, and upload its music and reply with a link to the
        song on Google Drive.
