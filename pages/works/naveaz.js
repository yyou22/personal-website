      NavEaz is an AI-powered smartwatch app designed to enhance driver safety by monitoring and predicting driver impairment in real time. 
      Using advanced machine learning algorithms developed and tested by our team, 
      NavEaz analyzes physiological signals like heart rate and electrodermal activity to detect fatigue, drowsiness, 
      and other impairments with high accuracy. 
      Our smart AI allows NavEaz to predict when a driver is about to lose focus, 
      ensuring that they correct their attention before danger arises.
